  <p>
    Gopher is a real-time web content plugin that enables ChatGPT to access up-to-date information from any website. This plugin expands ChatGPT's knowledge base beyond its training data, allowing it to provide more accurate and relevant information in response to user queries.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Gopher plugin fetches web content and converts it into a markdown format for easier processing by ChatGPT. It is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, making it an ideal solution for those who want to enhance their ChatGPT experience with real-time information from the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    While using the Gopher plugin, ChatGPT is expected to be helpful and honest. If the fetched content is too long, it will be chunked into smaller sections. Users must follow the provided URLs to access subsequent chunks. ChatGPT will inform the user about chunked content and ask if they want to fetch the rest of the chunks.
